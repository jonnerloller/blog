One of the major issues in C is that it was hard to express intention when it comes to function return types and function arguments.
There were only 2 ways to pass large data from one function to another - pointers or global variables. It should be obvious why global variables is probably not the best way to pass data to a function, so there's really only 1 way to pass large data from one function to another.

The problem with passing an object by pointer, is that it is difficult to express intention. 

{% highlight cpp %}
my_struct* some_function(const my_struct* in);
{% endhighlight %}

Take this function for example.
1. Can ```in``` be null?
2. Do I take ownership of ```in``` ?
3. Can I return ```null``` ?

Moving forward to C++, there were a few ways to better express ourselves.

{% highlight cpp %}
void some_function(const my_struct& in);
{% endhighlight %}

Passing by reference, So that we know that something can never be null, unless the caller is the one that causes undefined behavior.

{% highlight cpp %}
void some_function(std::unique_ptr<my_struct> in);
{% endhighlight %}

Passing by unique ptr, So that we know that we should take ownership of it.

{% highlight cpp %}
void some_function(std::shared_ptr<my_struct> in);
{% endhighlight %}

Passing by shared ptr, so that we know that we can share ownership of it. But, there are still things that is hard to express with the limited constructs we have. 
Look at the following example.

{% highlight cpp %}
my_struct some_function(int selector);
{% endhighlight %}

Lets say that we want ```some_function``` to return a ```my_struct```, only if ```selector == 1```. so perhaps, we could do use something we already have.

{% highlight cpp %}
std::unique_ptr<my_struct> some_function(int selector)
{
    if(selector == 1)
    {
        return std::make_unique<test_struct>();
    }
    return nullptr;
}
{% endhighlight %}

The problem here is that now we end up allocating more heap memory, when that is not our intention. I just want something to be initialized depending on a selector variable. But I can still allocate memory for that on the stack before hand.

In comes ```std::optional``` to save the day. ```std::optional``` is basically a wrapper around your class. 
The interface and usage is similar to that of a pointer. you can check if the value exists, you can compare optionals, you can dereference optionals, and you can reassign optionals. We can rewrite the above example with optionals. 

{% highlight cpp %}
std::optional<my_struct> some_function(int selector)
{
    if(selector == 1)
    {
        return test_struct();
    }
    return std::nullopt; // or return {};
}

void my_test()
{
    auto test = some_function(1);
    if(test)
    {
        std::cout << "Has test_struct" << std::endl;
    }
    else
    {
        std::cout << "Does not have test_struct" << std::endl;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

A real world of example is something that I used to encounter when I was writing my game engines back in school.

We wanted to get a name of an object, and we wanted to return the name of an object by ```const std::string&```. At that point in time, We wanted to establish the difference between an Uninitialized object, or a object who's name is (blank). So this was our initial implementation.
{% highlight cpp %}
const std::string& get_name() const
{
    static const std::string default = "UNDEFINED";
    if(some_check())
    {
        return name;
    }
    return default;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Looking back at it now, what I really wanted to do, was to call something like 
{% highlight cpp %}
std::optional<std::string> get_name() const
{
    if(some_check())
    {
        return name;
    }
    return std::nullopt;
}
{% endhighlight %}
There is still an issue in implementation in the above function, we now have the side effect of copying strings that we previously didn't
To work around that, we can use a ```std::reference_wrapper```. The modified code looks like such

{% highlight cpp %}
auto get_name() const
{
    return some_check() ? std::optional<std::reference_wrapper<std::string>>(name)
                        : std::nullopt;
}
{% endhighlight %}

This way, we can avoid additionally allocating more memory, since ```std::optional``` does not ever allocate memory for us. It is just a glorified wrapper around a
class with a initialization flag.

1 Question can be asked though, should we pass optional things via pointer, or via ```std::optional<std::reference_wrapper<T>>``` ? Initially, when I first learnt about optionals, I found that hey! This seems to be a nice way to pass things. It's kind of clear what you want to pass. But after working with it for a while. I felt that since we already have ```std::shared_ptr``` and ```std::unique_ptr``` as ways to pass around pointers that show ownership, and references for passing around non optional objects, we should be able to say that raw pointers should be reserved for passing around input parameters "optionally". Reserve the optoinal keyword more object creation in return types.
