It's finally here!

C++20 has been feature frozen. While I had no contribution at all to c++20, watching presentations, reading papers, and seeing how passionate
the c++ development committee was throughout this proposal phase really inspired me. C++ programmers were initially seen as people who were
using this "dead" or "dying" language. A language that many developers across the globe are terrified of using. It's "difficult to use", 
"doesn't provide significant benefits", has no proper / simple package managers.

Well, C++20 is here to save us all. Well not really, I'm definitely exagerrating a little bit. Or am I? Only time will tell.

I had wanted this blog to be a blog that talks about new features, as well as old features. Primarily as an excuse for me to write down stuff,
kinda like a dev diary, but also to encourage myself to write in a way that I can introduce newer programmers to c++. 

But, since C++20 is more or less fresh off the press, I'm going to start with c++20.

Tenative schedule is as follows.
1. Contracts
2. Ranges
3. Concepts
4. Calendars
5. Spaceship operator <=>
6. span
7. coroutines
8. some of the constexpr changes
9. Modules
10. Other features go here.

In between I might throw in some older c++, but for now I'll assume the following schedule.
