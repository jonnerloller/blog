# Variants

When I first heard of the concept of variants, I pondered about why It was needed. Most people I knew anyway didn't find it particularly useful. For most of my programming life, I worked in building game engines. There, Speed and effeciency usually trumps "super safe" code. If I could design something that would get a 50% speedup, with a uber low chance of it breaking, and in the instance that it does break we can patch just the instance that we are using, then we would do it.

Before I go over how I use it (which is likely to be wrong), let's introduce variants.

## Unions
To introduce Variants, we first have to re-visit a langugage feature called unions.

{% highlight cpp %}

union my_union
{
  int i,
  char c,
  float f,
  double d
};

int main()
{
    my_union a;
    a.i = 255;
    return a.c;
}

{% endhighlight %}

A union, unlike a struct, only allocates memory for the largest object in the union. At any one point of time, only 1 sub-object within the union should be used.
1 common use case of unions, is for ip addresses.

{% highlight cpp %}

union ipv4_address
{
  unsigned ints address;
  char octets[4];
};

{% endhighlight %}

This way, we can use ipv4 as eitehr the 32 bit string, or the way we commonly use ipv4 addresses : "XXX.YYY.ZZZ.WWW"

Here in lies in problem. with a union, at no point at time during execution of the program, are we able to check to see which type we are currently using at some point in time. If you knew where the address was being initialized, you might know. But if someone were to pass you this union as input data, there would be no possible way
for you to know which one is in use. Maybe you are smart and can find a way to figure out which one is invalid, given that here we have 2 variables. But what if our
union can have 10-20 different items. How would you know what type is being stored? 

## Tagged Unions

In early C++, people used to use what they called tagged unions. Basically, it's just a simple way for you keep track of your unions. A possible implementation is something like this,

{% highlight cpp %}
struct my_union
{
  enum
  {
    type_int,
    type_octet
  } tracker;
  union ipv4_address
  {
    unsigned ints address;
    char octets[4];
  };

  void print_address() const
  {
    if(tracker == type_int)
    {
      std::cout << address;
    }
    else if(tracker == type_octet)
    {
      std::cout << static_cast<int>(octets[0]) 
                << "." << static_cast<int>(octets[1])
                << "." << static_cast<int>(octets[2]) 
                << "." << static_cast<int>(octets[3]);
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Tagged unions seems like a great solution right? Well there is actually a huge problem. Unions were made during the "C" era, and they do not support custom C++ classes that are not trivial classes. Meaning that, with unions, you are not supposed to place elements in it that has constructors and destructors. There are ways to hack it to work, but It definitly is not the right way to do it.

## Variants

At some point, people in the c++ community decided that they should have a c++ type-safe union, so variants were invented.

Variants can be used in a variety of ways.

{% highlight cpp %}
#include <variant>
int main()
{
  std::variant<int,float,double> test;
  test = 6.5;
  if constexpr (std::holds_alternative<double>(test))
  {
    // do something
  }

  test = 1;
  try 
  {
    std::get<int>(test);
  } catch(std::bad_variant_access&){}

  test = 1.5f;

  auto* my_result = std::get_if<float>(&test);
  if(my_result)
  {
    // do something with *my_resutt.
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}


Here you can see a couple of ways that we can extract the data from variant. There are more, but I feel that here are the more useful ones.

On top of writing these code manually, variants also provide you write a custom visitor for the variant.


{% highlight cpp %}
#include <variant>
int main() {
  std::variant<int,float,double> test;
  test = 4;
  auto type = std::visit([](auto&& arg) {
      using T = std::decay_t<decltype(arg)>;
      if constexpr (std::is_same_v<T, int>)
          return 0;
      else if constexpr (std::is_same_v<T, float>)
          return 1;
      else if constexpr (std::is_same_v<T, double>)
          return 2;
      else 
          static_assert(always_false<T>::value, "non-exhaustive visitor!");
      return -1;
  }, w);
}
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, we can pass in a lambda function to ```std::visit```, and we can query for the type of the object, and perform some kind of operation for each type.
I found this especially useful in parsing, but I guess, It can get really handy whenever you have an "xor" operation.

For example, in parsing C code, an expression can be a lot of different small expressions, but never more than 1 expression at a time.

```cpp
// I should probabably add some actual examples here at some point.
```
