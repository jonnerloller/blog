This post got out of hand rather quickly. 

If you are too lazy to read and just want to see what spans look like

1 of the issues that has plagued C for the longest of times is the inability to pass arrays as arguments to functions.

Take the following code snippet for example.

{% highlight cpp %}

void print_array (int arr [100]);

int main()
{
    int arr[100];
    print_array(arr);
    return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}

The code above is 100% legitimate C/C++ code. it works, and compiles as intended.
If that's the case, then what is this inability to pass arrays as arguments issue?


{% highlight cpp %}

void print_array (int arr [100]);

int main()
{
    int arr[30];
    print_array(arr);
    return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}

Well, here's the issue. The code above also is 100% legitimate C/C++ code. it compiles as intended,
but there could be potential risks in the function since we are going out of bounds.

In fact, we could write code like 

{% highlight cpp %}

void print_array (int arr []);

{% endhighlight %}

or like 

{% highlight cpp %}

void print_array (int* arr);

{% endhighlight %}

and there wouldn't be a differnce also.
Basically in C/C++, there is no way to pass an array to a function, it gets demoted to a pointer. This applies to multidimensional array as well.

{% highlight cpp %}

void print_array (int arr[20][30]);

{% endhighlight %}

is basically the same as

{% highlight cpp %}

void print_array (int arr[][30]);

{% endhighlight %}

is basically the same as

{% highlight cpp %}

void print_array (int (*arr)[30]);

{% endhighlight %}

So how would one pass around arrays to a function.

## There are a few ways.

1. Classic C method
2. c++ template method

### 1. Classic C method

{% highlight cpp %}

// 1.
void modify_array(int *arr, int size)
{
  for(int i=0; i <size; ++i)
   {
       arr[i] = i;
   }
}

int main()
{
    int arr[10] = {};
    modify_array(arr,10);
    return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}

## The Classic C method

It's classic. It works. But it's clunky. Every time you want to call this function, you need to pass in the size of the array at hand.
if you are declaring a C style array, you occasionally forget to update the size, resulting in lots of needless debugging.

{% highlight cpp %}

// 1.
void modify_array(int *arr, int size)
{
  for(int i=0; i <size; ++i)
   {
       arr[i] = i;
   }
}

int main()
{
    static const int size = 10;
    // does not compile.
    int arr[size] = {};
    modify_array(arr,size);
    return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}

You'd like to write something like this, but it does not compile in C because variables cannot be used as initialzation for static arrays.
You don't want to use a dynamic array, so you use a macro instead.


{% highlight cpp %}

#define ARRAY_SIZE 10

// 1.
void modify_array(int *arr, int size)
{
  for(int i=0; i <size; ++i)
   {
       arr[i] = i;
   }
}

int main()
{
    // does not compile.
    int arr[ARRAY_SIZE] = {};
    modify_array(arr,ARRAY_SIZE);
    return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}

This works, but you are basically not relying on the language to help you accomplish your task.
preprocessor macros generally make code harder to debug, and when used wrongly, can create the toughest bugs to solve.

{% highlight cpp %}

// 1.
void modify_array(int *arr, int size)
{
  for(int i=0; i <size; ++i)
   {
       arr[i] = i;
   }
}

int main()
{
    int arr[] = {1,2,3,4};
    modify_array(arr,sizeof(arr) / sizeof(int));
    return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}

You grow a bit smarter, and learn a trick that lets you automatically deduce the size of the array, but now you need to always remember
the type of your array. In C, maybe not so complicated. But in c++, quite complicated.

{% highlight cpp %}

// 1.
void modify_array(int *arr, int size)
{
  for(int i=0; i <size; ++i)
   {
       arr[i] = i;
   }
}

int main()
{
    int arr[] = {1,2,3,4};
    modify_array(arr,sizeof(arr) / size(arr[0]));
    return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}

You grow even smarter. Using tricks you learnt from a C programming guide to aid you along your journey.
You are able to accomplish what you want, with minimal maintenance. 1 small problem. It's not very expressive.
All you really wanted to do, was to write

{% highlight cpp %}

// 1.
void modify_array(int arr [])
{
  for(int i=0; i <size; ++i)
   {
       arr[i] = i;
   }
}

int main()
{
    int arr[] = {1,2,3,4};
    modify_array(arr);
    return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}

### 2. C++ template method
{% highlight cpp %}

// 2.
template <int Size>
void modify_array(int (&arr)[Size])
{
  for(int i=0; i <Size; ++i)
   {
       arr[i] = i;
   }
}
int main()
{
    int arr[] = {1,2,3,4};
    modify_array(arr);
    return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}

Hey. we wrote a function that uses templates to automatically deduce the size of the array. Seems like it's exactly what we wanted. right?
Well yes and no. There isn't a problem with this code specifically. But static arrays are honestly, quite a luxury. Most of the time, we deal
with dynamic arrays. We can't pass a std::array into this code. Nor can we pass in a std::vector. In fact, that's what of the benefts of using the Classic C style function. The same interface works with any kind of iteratable container.
Since it's basically s pointer and a size, that seems to be better then having to deal with arrays and pointers seperately.

That is basically the whole point of C++20 spans. **To be able to use a standard interface across any "iterable" or "span" of objects, without having to check for out of bounds** 


## tldr;

Here's what spans will look like in c++20

{% highlight cpp %}

template <int Size>
void print_array(std::span<int>& arr)
{
  for(auto& elem : arr)
  {
      std::cout << elem << " ";
  }
}

int main()
{
    int a[] = {1,2,3,4,5};
    // raw c/c++ array
    print_array(a);

    std::array<int,20> b= {};
    // std::array
    print_array(b);

    std::vector<int> c = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7};
    // container
    print_array(c);

    std::initializer_list<int> d= {1,2,3,4,5};
    // container
    print_array(d);

    int *first = &a[0];
    int *last = &a[4];
    // first,last
    print_array(std::span(first,last));
    // first,count
    print_array(std::span(first,4));

}

{% endhighlight %}

All it takes is to create a span is to pass in something that can be constructed into a span.
There are a couple of ways to create a span. Most of them are intuitive.

Some properties of spans include
1. They themselves are immutable while the data that they are "viewing" or "pointing to" depends on the type.
2. Basically functions the same way a std::array / std::vector works in terms of interface

Initially, I thought little of spans. I've been working with c++ without spans for years without problems, writing if checks without safety.
But recently, when I went to refactor some old code, It definitely wasn't nice to deal with.

So spans. Do I think they were a necessary c++ feature?

Yes. Not because It wasn't simple enough for me to implement my own, but more so that I think it makes it easier to educate the next generation in c++.

C++ is hard to teach. It's bogged down with old / ancient tutorials, some dating back to C days. Luckily there is a WG dedicated now to figuring out how we should go about teaching c++,
but I hope that we continue to empower the future generation of c++ programmers to not be afraid of this language. We're finding more and more ways to write good, clear, expressive code that
still harnesses the power of C++.
